# CS393

In this class, I learned Spring Framework applications and usage area of it. 
In the Homework 1, I created Shop-Product-Order-Customer relationship with using MVC and it utilize from Derby Remote Database.
In the Homework 2, I used Homework 1 and add the REST controller to same implementation. In this homework, I learned how to use Postman and RESTApi implementations.
In the Homework 3, I create a very simple frontend for my Homework 2. To do that, I write an HTML class and one JavaScript class. In the frontend, user can select products and add them to cart and he/she can purchase them. When products are purchased, new order is created on the database.
In the term-project, I implemented an API like StackOverFlow site. I have Question - Comment - Answer - User models and relationships of them. Also, I used same database with homeworks. Additionally, I used Swagger2 for visualizing my implementation.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION ABOUT THEM, YOU CAN ASK ME ANY TIME.
